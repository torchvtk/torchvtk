## Contributing

This project is still very small, however we are gladly accepting contributions of all kinds. However it might be in both your and our interest, if you start by [writing an issue](https://github.com/xeTaiz/torchvtk/issues/new) first, then we can discuss together how this could best be realized.

If more people are interested in contributing, we will figure out some appropriate guidelines :)
